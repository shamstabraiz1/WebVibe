# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project focuses on developing a robust Urdu sentiment analysis system that can effectively handle dialectal variations and informal text commonly found in social media and user-generated content. The system will leverage pre-trained Urdu language models and fine-tuning techniques to achieve high accuracy across different Urdu dialects and writing styles, addressing a critical gap in Urdu NLP tools.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher analyzing Urdu social media content, I want to classify sentiment in Urdu text with high accuracy, so that I can understand public opinion and emotional trends in Urdu-speaking communities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Urdu text is input to the system THEN the system SHALL classify it as positive, negative, or neutral with at least 85% accuracy
2. WHEN the input contains mixed script (Urdu and Roman Urdu) THEN the system SHALL handle both scripts and provide accurate sentiment classification
3. WHEN the system processes a batch of texts THEN it SHALL return results within 2 seconds per 100 texts on GPU hardware

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a social media analyst, I want the system to handle different Urdu dialects and informal language, so that I can analyze sentiment across diverse Urdu-speaking populations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text contains dialectal variations (Punjabi-influenced Urdu, Sindhi-influenced Urdu, etc.) THEN the system SHALL maintain at least 80% accuracy
2. WHEN informal language, slang, or abbreviated forms are present THEN the system SHALL correctly identify sentiment patterns
3. WHEN code-mixed text (Urdu-English) is processed THEN the system SHALL handle the mixed content appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer integrating sentiment analysis, I want a well-documented API and model, so that I can easily incorporate Urdu sentiment analysis into my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the model is deployed THEN it SHALL provide a REST API with clear documentation
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL return structured JSON responses with confidence scores
3. WHEN batch processing is requested THEN the system SHALL support processing up to 1000 texts in a single API call

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an NLP researcher, I want comprehensive evaluation metrics and analysis, so that I can understand the model's performance across different text types and dialects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluation is performed THEN the system SHALL report accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each sentiment class
2. WHEN dialectal analysis is conducted THEN the system SHALL provide performance breakdown by dialect/region
3. WHEN error analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL identify and categorize common failure patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want the system to work with limited labeled data, so that I can apply it to domains where large annotated datasets are not available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training with limited data (< 5000 samples) THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 75% accuracy through transfer learning
2. WHEN few-shot learning is applied THEN the system SHALL adapt to new domains with minimal additional training data
3. WHEN data augmentation techniques are used THEN the system SHALL improve performance on small datasets by at least 10%

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want robust preprocessing and error handling, so that the system can handle real-world noisy text data reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN malformed or corrupted text is input THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and return appropriate error messages
2. WHEN text contains excessive noise (special characters, URLs, mentions) THEN the system SHALL clean and normalize the text appropriately
3. WHEN empty or very short texts are processed THEN the system SHALL return appropriate neutral classifications or error responses
